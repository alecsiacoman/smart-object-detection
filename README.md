# Smart Object Recognition: Classification of Coffee Mugs and Water Bottles

## Introduction

### Problem Definition
This project aims to build an **image classification system** capable of distinguishing between **coffee mugs** and **water bottles**. The model will be trained using a dataset of labeled images and deployed in a real-world scenario through a **mobile application** that captures photos and identifies the object category.

This task falls under **pattern recognition** and **computer vision**, with practical relevance in retail inventory management, smart kitchen assistants, waste sorting, and accessibility tools.

### Importance & Context
In everyday environments, being able to automatically recognize simple household items like mugs or bottles is a foundational step toward **intelligent vision systems**.  
Applications include:
- **Retail automation:** automatic product recognition at checkout.
- **Smart home devices:** identifying utensils or containers.
- **Assistive technology:** describing items to users via voice.
- **Mobile AR experiences:** recognizing physical items through a phone camera.

By developing a robust classification system for these two categories, we demonstrate how small-scale image classification models can form the basis for larger AI systems.
